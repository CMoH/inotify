Introduction
------------
Inotify is on erlang port for the Linux inotify API allowing one to monitor
changes to files and directory in the filesystem.

Installation
------------
If building from git:

$ rebar compile

If using as a dependency in another rebar project add this snippet to the projects
rebar.config:

  {deps, [
        ... other dependencies ...
        {inotify, ".*", {git, "https://github.com/sheyll/inotify.git"}}]}

Documentation
-------------

This is an OTP application. When started files and directories can be
watched by calling 'inotify:watch(File, Tag)'. Tag is a user defined
term that will later be used to associate notification event listeners to
the specific events they are interested in.
All file notifications are published via a gen_event. 

Users can either write a full blown gen_event handler and add it to 'inotify_evt'
via gen_event:add[_sup]_handler/3 or  they can implement the
'inotify_evt' behaviour and call 'inotify:add_handler(Tag, Module, Args)'.
In that case Module:inotify_evt(...) will be called for each event corresponding
to 'Tag'.

For an example refer to the unit test in "test/inotify_test.erl".

More documentation is contained in the source code, you might
want to run

$ rebar doc

which generates HTML documentation in the "doc" sub directory.


License
-------
In short, you can do anything you want with the code including using it as part
of you plan for world domination (if your successful can I have one of the nicer
countries please). No responsiblity it taken for the fitness of the any purpose,
etc, etc. The only thing I ask is that if you find a bug and fix send me the
patch. Likewise, feature suggestions and patches are welcome.

TODO
----
* add support for multiple controller functions
* Write some documentation!
